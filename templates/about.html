                <h2>What I hope to Give</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to strive to be as useful to my employer as possible. 
                    I appreciate when people I work with do their job and go beyond what is expected, 
                    becuase it's an idea I've always try to uphold in my work. I know what it's like 
                    to work with people who don't try to pull their own weight and I will not be like that. 
                    I want to hop in and take on responsibility, not only to help my team, but also to learn 
                    in a "trial by fire" sort of way.

                <h2>What I hope to Gain</h2>
                <p>
                    What I hope to gain most is the skills to write more complex code and to understand code better. 
                    I hope that I can grow as a programmer, a worker, and a person. I strive to grow better every day,
                    so I'm looking for the same kind of environment in my future work place.
