My Project Portfolio

  This is a website for my portfolio that stores all of my recent projects.

How to run it:
  
  Clone or download my repo, create and activate a virtual environment in your preferred code editor, download the requirements found in my 
requirements.txt file, then run app.py in the terminal. You'll need to look for http://127.0.0.1:8000, open that in your local browser 
to view my portfolio. 

What I learned:

  I really enjoyed this project, mainly because it had so many moving parts, which allowed me to play around and really understand what was happening 
underneath the code. I learned a lot through this process. A quite important understanding I gained was the relationship between the frontend 
and the backend of a website. Though I don't fully understand the intricacies of HTML and CSS, I did learn quite a bit more and at least know how
to look for an answer - I used the inspect tool in the browser a lot and it's actually one of the most helpful tools I've ever used. One part I thought 
was really cool to learn was the http and networking side of building software and websites. I now understand that http is a language to send data
between systems, and the methods used to send that data (such as GET and POST). I also got better overall with other skills, such as initializing 
and using a database (which was slightly different since I used Flask with SQLAlchemy, instead of SQLAlchemy by itself). I got better with GitHub 
in the terminal and actually remembering to commit my changes. I better understand the parts of a database and what they do, such as the models.py 
being a blueprint of the data in the database and how different types of data, especilly data input, require different interactions.
